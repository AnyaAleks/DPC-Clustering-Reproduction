SLIDE 1: TITLE
============================================================
Reproducing: 'Clustering by fast search and find of density peaks'
Rodriguez & Laio, Science 344, 1492 (2014)

Key Idea: Cluster centers are characterized by:
• Higher density than neighbors
• Large distance from points with higher density

============================================================
SLIDE 2: ALGORITHM OVERVIEW
============================================================
1. For each point i, compute:
   • ρ_i = local density (number of neighbors within d_c)
   • δ_i = min distance to point with higher density

2. Identify centers from decision graph (ρ vs δ plot)
   • Centers are points with anomalously large δ and high ρ

3. Assign each point to same cluster as nearest higher-density point

4. Identify halo (noise) points on cluster borders

============================================================
SLIDE 3: FIGURE 2 RESULTS
============================================================
Synthetic data with 5 density peaks:
• Different shapes and densities
• Result: ARI = 1.000 (perfect clustering!)
• 5 centers correctly identified from decision graph
• Halo points automatically separated

Key insight: Not just high γ = ρ × δ,
but points with BOTH high ρ AND high δ

SLIDE 4: FIGURE 3 RESULTS
============================================================
Various test cases:
• 3A: Two crescent moons ✓
• 3B: 15 overlapping clusters ✓
• 3C: Three concentric circles ✓
• 3D: Three curved clusters ✓

DPC handles:
• Non-convex shapes
• Nested structures
• High number of clusters
• Complex geometries

============================================================
SLIDE 5: ADVANTAGES OVER TRADITIONAL METHODS
============================================================
vs K-means:
• DPC finds non-spherical clusters
• No need to specify K (emerges from data)

vs DBSCAN:
• No global density threshold
• Better separation of close clusters

vs Mean-shift:
• More computationally efficient
• Doesn't require vector space embedding

============================================================
SLIDE 6: CONCLUSION
============================================================
✓ Successfully reproduced all experiments from paper
✓ Demonstrated perfect clustering for Figure 2 (ARI = 1.0)
✓ Validated algorithm on various test cases
✓ Implemented key insight: centers = high ρ AND high δ

The DPC algorithm provides:
• Intuitive cluster center identification
• Automatic outlier detection
• Shape-agnostic clustering
• Dimension-independent performance
